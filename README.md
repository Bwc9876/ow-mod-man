## Release Profile

To reduce binary sizes, some features have been enabled that will slow down release compile time, but make a significantly smaller binary.

## Contributing

You'll need rust and cargo.

First:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Bwc9876/ow-mod-man/
```

Then check each package for guide on running and contributing.

**Please format your code (`cargo fmt`) and lint it (`cargo clippy --fix`)**

Also make sure if you're working on platform-specific behaviour to test it on all platforms.
